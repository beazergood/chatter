Welcome to le-chat 🐱💬🇫🇷
A pawsome chat app for cats.

Whether you know Javascript or not, hopefully you will be able to read this project and understand how it works as well as how I build software.

There's two apps to run: client and server

Client
Contains a very simple Angular app with a couple of screens for reading and sending messages to other users in a chat room.

Tools & libraries core to my development workflow include:
    - Storybook to develop components and build a component library
    - TailwindCSS for easy to maintain styling
    - Cypress to drive development with less effort and bake in some security/confidence in the code
